<h3>Sal's Shoulder </h3>
<p/>
<i> Friday June 26, 1987 </i>
<p/>
I was 25 and testosterone practically controlled the weather.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier that year some old friends from Minnesota had come out to California
and I had found us a house to rent.&nbsp;&nbsp;They all brought motorcycles, and I had
just begun a personal campaign of racing on the weekends.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my friends
was an aircraft mechanic and we rebuilt the engines on everything we had
multiple times because we blew them up multiple times, my race bike virtually
every other week.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rare occasions I wasn't rebuilding that bike during the week
I was riding it to work to determine if the latest tune had improved power.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'd attach a mirror, but no turn signals, license plate, or lights.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Track tires so sticky they'd collect cigarette butts and lotto scratchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud exhaust.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Blood red bodywork and leather onesie to match, both with black asphalt scuffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vehicle performance is nothing, of course, without skill and knowledge of the course.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There were business parks all around with winding streets, curving lots packed with cars,
a few loading docks, and branching jogging paths.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two smart moves would put you out of sight,
and I ran from police routinely with perfect success.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That afternoon I left work early.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hwy 237 is a dozen straight miles
with eight stop lights.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideal for practicing my launch technique and 
listening for unacceptable engine noises at redline.&nbsp;&nbsp;The house was at the end of Knights Bridge Road.&nbsp;&nbsp;
No cul du sac, just a fence with a few acres of apple trees on the other side.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Very quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most driveways were still empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept the revs down for the stay-at-homes enjoying their soaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My driveway was also empty which meant Beverly was out buying groceries for the Friday BBQ.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was her only job outside the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;I pulled up and shut the bike down and pulled off my gloves
and helmet, unlocked the front door and went through to the garage and hit the opener.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was pushing the bike into the garage when I heard it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a sound Bev had told me she heard sometimes in the afternoons when she was
sunbathing in the back yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman crying, begging, terrified.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I never asked Bev why she didn't call 9-1-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was cop-phobic, got both good and bad twitchy 
when I drove fast with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;I figured she had warrants.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had few
possessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traveled light, she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never saw ID and wondered if I knew her real name.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the sound was real, primal, and couldn't have been far.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not coming from the orchard, so somewhere easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My helmet was on the bike's tank, gloves inside, but my crystalized course of action 
required bare hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had never worn gloves while holding a gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my housemate's room I did a quick search for his Glock.&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked it.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the range
I'd found it more manageable.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I found the Colt first.&nbsp;&nbsp;A .45 revolver in stainless steel.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hand cannon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Big, noticeable.&nbsp;&nbsp;I pulled the zip on my leathers a bit up from my 
crotch and tucked the weapon inside and headed out and down the sidewalk, listening.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The houses had all been built at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranch style.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the same layout.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The third house on our side belonged to Sal.&nbsp;&nbsp;His sheriff's cruiser was parked in his driveway.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the weekends, he would wheel out his '64 Corvette for the world to admire.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were jealous.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One day not long after our move in when we were all out in the driveway working on my Firebird,
a '71 with the 455, dialing in a new Holley, Sal had walked up and introduced himself,
pointing back toward his house and the green and white cruiser.&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd said he personally 
didn't mind the noise but knew certain neighbors would soon complain.&nbsp;&nbsp;He advised we adopt an
8 p.m. cutoff and also that we introduce ourselves to everyone in a friendly way,
pass out our phone number so they would be inclined to tell us when enough was enough 
rather than call the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my roommates suggested a BBQ and Sal said that sounded 
like a fine idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;So that became the Friday tradition, a weekly bribe.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sauntered, holding the gun inside the red leather, feeling self-conscious but not as
stupid as I would have holding the shiny pistol for whoever to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as I got to Sal's
I heard it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;No question, that house.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought, maybe he's watching a video.&nbsp;&nbsp;
His TV had to be in the same spot ours was, back of the house in the living room near the
sliding glass doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I'd look and if that was it, I'd find some way to mention
sometime later that he might want to keep those doors closed, maybe install AC.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what
I was thinking as I snuck along the side of his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got to the corner and took my peek.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The sliding doors were open and his TV was where I expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was off.&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman was 
definitely inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I stepped into his living room.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was still possible it was a video
if he had a TV in his bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was through a square archway that led to a short hall.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The master bedroom door had to be open from what I was hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that even if I peeked
through and he happened to see me, I could explain why I was in his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Might get awkward,
especially if he was jerking off on his bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;But hey.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks earlier he had offered a Monday afternoon ride-along in his cruiser.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I skipped work for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was weird being in the front passenger seat,
and also cramped:  radio gear intruded and three clipboards were Velcroed across the face of the dash.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One held a compilation of BOLOs from agencies all around the Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Smack in the middle of the first page was a sketchy description of me and my bike.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a minute
I thought he'd tricked me.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we just drove around.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal pointed things out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many drivers took 
their foot off the gas when they noticed the cruiser in their mirror, mostly those going the limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sal approved:  at least they were checking.&nbsp;&nbsp;But of those, it was fun to note how many rolled windows 
up or down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Power windows: a convenient way to look suspect.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing exciting had happened, and Sal said it often didn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;The police patrolled much more
than the sheriffs did, and were usually the first to handle most incidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, it had 
felt like a real welcome, almost a bonding experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was grateful, and had told him so.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those positives in mind, I leaned around the archway.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal was ten feet away, in the doorway
to the master bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweat made his back hair topographical.&nbsp;&nbsp;Uniform boots and trousers, but no gun belt.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In fact, he held a regular belt in his left hand, folded in half.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I could see over his shoulder into the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife, Dee, was standing on their bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or rather, she had one foot on a pillow and the other on a nightstand with her
back pressed against the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She was naked and covered in bruises.&nbsp;&nbsp;Multicolored arms, torso, thighs,
scabbed in places, with at least two fresh bleeding welts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And over her husband's shoulder, she saw me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her expression changed from animal to human, like I was a cloud shading her with a new dimension of sorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She recognized me, but what was
I doing there?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal saw the change, saw her eyes, and started to turn his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculation for me was easy, reptilian flashcard stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't allow him to see me, I couldn't
allow him to continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;My feet moved and the .45 came out of my leathers and fired.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ACP round is
subsonic, but loud at the range and absolutely deafening in a residential hallway.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hadn't braced my 
arm and the recoil sent the gun back and punched my collarbone, luckily an area with a plastic armored 
pad under the leather.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal went down, hewn, face to the carpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of my narrowed vision
I saw Dee jump from the bed, to the left, toward the master bath, leaving smears on the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned to leave, automatically moving to tuck the gun back under my leather, but stopped myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I felt the barrel with my fingertips.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even warm from a single round.&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe to put near my t-shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I left.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heading back toward my house, I told myself not to run, but I wasn't running.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I was stunned.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Auditorily, intellectually, emotionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time I reached my driveway and waded into the garage I was up to my chin in second-guessing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could have used a payphone to anonymously call for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But Dee hadn't, perhaps knowing responding officers would side with Sal.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could have fired into the floor or ceiling, at best briefly jangling him, but likely becoming a 
disappeared witnesss when he recovered his wits and firearm.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could have just rung the doorbell until he came to the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, see above.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibly related to the roaring in my ears I had a vision of myself being pulled backward toward
a waterfall, anticipating the irreversible change in perspective where I'd be looking up at lost reality
through a spray of magical thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But racing had taught that even wild slides can be saved by steadfastly looking where I wanted to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So.&nbsp;&nbsp;Look.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still no cars in other driveways.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a nightmare is bad enough, you won't realize you're already looking through the spray.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I could have just jumped back on the bike.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead I went for peek-a-boo, implausible deniability 
be damned.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the workbench I took a fresh shop rag from the bag and
wiped the gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I found the biggest screwdriver we had, an ancient thing with an orange and black
striped handle.&nbsp;&nbsp;We used it mostly as a pry bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;I stuck the end in the gun barrel and walked through
the house, the living room, our sliding glass doors, into the brown grass of the back yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing
After putting a quick eye to the biggest knothole in the gray redwood fence,
I cranked back and threw the Colt as far into the orchard
as I possibly could.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I walked back to the garage and put the screwdriver away, binned the rag,
scrubbed my hands and leather sleeve with a fresh rag spritzed with grease remover, binned it, 
sat on the step leading inside and unzipped my boots, unzipped the cuffs of my leathers and 
began peeling them off.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was mostly out when I heard my Firebird, about four blocks away.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverly was remarkably deft with the clutch.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three stop signs on our road, two 
on an upward slope.&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't stall the engine or spin the tires.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was slipping on the old pair of tennis shoes I kept in the garage
when she pulled up.&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze through the house made my sweaty skin prickle.&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave the
Firdbird's throttle a quick tap in greeting and shut it down and got out, dressed as usual.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gym shorts and t-shirt, same as me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Version two of the same obvious option.&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn that beast around and jet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Early dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Discussing weekend plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Couldn't have been me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Timestamped receipt.&nbsp;&nbsp;But.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Home early."&nbsp;&nbsp;That smooth contralto.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She was thoroughly tanned and her auburn hair was sun-bleached to a lighter red.&nbsp;&nbsp;She never 
wore a bra, counting on logos to keep her nipples from showing through her/my shirts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Penzoil that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;(A sponsor, gave me a box of them plus stickers and products by the gallon.)
Making a grocery bag and flip-flops belong on a runway in Paris, she panthered up and purred,
"Unload the heavy stuff?"&nbsp;&nbsp;Her tongue tasted like ice cream.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got out the big plastic coolers and grabbed the bags of ice from the trunk, layering in
the green bottles of beer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolling Rock was our brand that summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;In between the clinking
of glass I was straining for the sounds of sirens, but my ears were still ringing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I went around
back and wheeled out the Weber and filled it with charcoal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave it a very liberal dousing
of lighter fluid and then stepped back to where I was out of the fume zone and struck a
wooden match, tossing it in the same gesture à la my dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;Got a good fireball that rattled the 
hanging utensiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wondered if I was too wired to have sex one last time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kitchen Bev was slapping hamburger into patties.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned her around and boosted
her up onto the counter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice cream.&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably a Frosty from Wendy's.&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled my shirt
over my head and wiped her hands on it and tossed it in the sink.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ready to go, as per.&nbsp;&nbsp;Roof, food, weed, TV, no job, an arrangement established the day we met.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She pointed her toes and kicked off her sandals.&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard them hit the cabinets and then
the floor, but then she tensed.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hear that?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
She turned her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair was cute, short, and ultra fine, and it brushed my nose.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Very pleasant.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow," she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I heard the sirens.&nbsp;&nbsp;They weren't just in the 
neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were coming up our road.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several species.&nbsp;&nbsp;Different departments.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On our block now.&nbsp;&nbsp;She stared at me in panic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue eyes very wide.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Firebird I dismissed immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast, but I needed lightning with a saddle.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The bike could be run down the sidewalk, across lawns if need be.&nbsp;&nbsp;My work badge was still in the 
inner pocket of my leathers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could hide in my office, maybe even get the bike in there.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the 
door would log my entry.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, what, I'd eat break room vending machine crap all weekend?&nbsp;&nbsp;So, no.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I could fly up to San Francisco and beg a friend to help me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hit my bank, maybe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then fly again.&nbsp;&nbsp;
South?&nbsp;&nbsp;North?&nbsp;&nbsp;Planes were probably out.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's cool," I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;I pulled my shirt on inside out and stepped around to the front door.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a parade.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three cop cars, ambulance, and a damn fire engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;My tax dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cops slewed to sloppy
diagonals in front of Sal's.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambulance stopped on the near side of the street, the fire engine opposite.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, lawns then.&nbsp;&nbsp;And far side of the fire engine in case the cops got trigger-happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I went into the garage and muscled my bike around so it was pointed out and 
went about pulling my sticky leathers back on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Always legs, zip cuffs, boots, zip, arms, zip cuffs, front zip.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I got as far as my boots when I realized it 
should already be too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;I stuck my head out of the big garage door.&nbsp;&nbsp;No uniforms
were running up the sidewalk toward our house that I could see.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawns, I thought, and
craned out further to scan the neighbors' azaleas and birches and whatnot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where ya goin'?" Bev asked, her voice an octave higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nowhere."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I come?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been about to pull the upper half of my race suit on over the hamburgery t-shirt,
and felt mental tides trying to turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;I carefully pulled the shirt off, dropped it and thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Maybe regular street gear would give me some camo.&nbsp;&nbsp;Black leather jacket hanging right there,
pick one of my other helmets from the shelf above.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paint-flecked jeans there, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wallet, can't forget.&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at the red race bike covered in sponsor stickers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain to yank those off.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My two old canyon carvers were down.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 400 two-stroke had a hole in a piston and the 500 thumper had its 
clapped-out rear shocks in a box on the garage floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I pulled over a shop stool and started unzipping my boots I said, "I need your shirt."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'd shucked the clammy cowhide off my legs and stood, Beverly was holding it out,
her expression concern and confusion spackled with coquettishness.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hung it around my neck
and it all seemed a bit funny, both of us nearly naked in the garage with the big door open,
breeze blowing, skin tightening, radios squawking words and codes outside. 
The shirt smelled fantastic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some situations offset others.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly her chest was against mine,
her legs around my waist.&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling walls with one hand I walked to my bedroom, our bedroom, the master.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Next level.&nbsp;&nbsp;No tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month prior, coming off the corkscrew at Laguna Seca, through turns 9 and 10 and carrying 
3rd gear through turn 11 onto the straight heading for the finish, I'd been hyper-aware of
the rear tire slding a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea each race is to completely use up a set of tires.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Otherwise you weren't trying hard enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tires wore much more toward the edges
than in the middle due to extra forces when cornering.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first few turns could be guesswork,
especially if there had been a delayed start or you'd misgauged pressure versus ambient temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Given a lap or two, sliding usually became predictable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Different for each brand, but learnable.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I had developed a system of counting the number and length of slides.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Yokohamas I was running that day were good for 113 moderate slides, each side.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Beyond that you were likely riding on exposed cords and the romp could end before the race was over.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There and then, we were at 112 on the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;During a slide the loss of traction means the tire is 
spinning slightly faster than when fully hooked up.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tire is also smaller in diameter on edge
than standing up so that factors in, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;The engine was pulling hard for victory,
slightly above redline.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I rolled her out of that final turn, up on to the cooler center portion
of the tire, I heard and felt the hookup.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was subtle, a soft grunt, which was good.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A jerk could set everything wobbling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, she smoothly started climbing her chain, front tire floating
higher and higher above the track.&nbsp;&nbsp;Body english will let you steer a bit, but I was good with where we were going.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The checkered flag waved, big and flashy, and the front came down and kissed the asphalt, nice and easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Personal bests.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedroom, hastily swabbed and still gasping, we began pulling on fresh everything like it was yet another 
Olympic event.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever was coming, may as well be comfortable, or less uncomfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Beverly grabbed my shoulder while jamming her slim tan feet into her tennies, white with polka dots.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm not sure I can climb the fence."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An idea I hadn't considered.&nbsp;&nbsp;No vehicle?&nbsp;&nbsp;No.&nbsp;&nbsp;But then it clicked.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't seconds,
but minutes too far now.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hooked the belt loops of her jeans and kissed her again.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Won't need to."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out front, I sat on the fender of the Firebird.&nbsp;&nbsp;A nice metallic blue.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd bought Bev panties the same shade
to commemorate a religious experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The hood had a center ridge that ran from the windshield to the beak-like bumper.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In April, on the afternoon I'd finally gotten the new carburetor properly jetted to let the big motor
maintain a lumpy idle, around 550 RPM, Bev had perched on the nose of the car and in less than five seconds
slapped the hood, slid off, and nearly dropped to her knees.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd guided her around, opened the door,
and let her collapse into the passenger seat where, eyes closed and skin dewy, she'd whispered:  
"Tap-dancing Christ."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the professional responders were inside Sal's house.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I went back and forth about smoking a joint.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was nothing to see for so long, I grabbed a beer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at last the paramedics 
rolled Sal out, not in a bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking close behind was Dee, in a hoodie and black sweat pants.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I realized that was how she was always dressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two pushed the gurney 
into their rig, and then one of them extended a hand to help Dee up and in.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another closed the doors, then got behind the wheel.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambulance made a multi-point turn because 
the fire engine was in the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it drove away, lights and siren.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's happening?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sal got brought out of his house on a stretcher.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dee went with."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shit," Bev said, sidling out of the garage.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow," hands in her hair, nervous near so many 
flashing lights.&nbsp;&nbsp;I imagined her hair longer, in a mug shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire crew left, backing to the cross street and heading off in a different direction
than they'd come.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then an unmarked Crown Vic arrived and a detective went inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;I opened another
beer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was halfway through it when one of my roommates came home.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric parked down by the corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once past the light show he waved, I waved back.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holy crap," he said, leaning against the Firebird's door.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sal got taken out on a stretcher."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed a beer.&nbsp;&nbsp;"We still grillin'?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ready to go."&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;"But maybe we shouldn't do it out front this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If neighbors come, it might seem--"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like entertainment."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the word?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crass?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Something."&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the Weber.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think we can move it hot?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we're careful.&nbsp;&nbsp;'S got wheels."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Rob came home.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then finally Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few neighbors.&nbsp;&nbsp;No more cops.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ate burgers in the back yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverly drank and smoked and laughed a bit more than usual.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bill went inside to get his tin of tobacco, I followed and then led him to the garage
and closed the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dude," I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Got to tell you something."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah?"&nbsp;&nbsp;Wary.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Colt."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah?"&nbsp;&nbsp;Louder.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put a finger against my lips.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used it."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced from me toward the back yard, probably thinking that Beverly seemed okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tipped my head.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You--" he started to say. 
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded.&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "He was beating on Dee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Really bad."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes moved around as he worked it from different angles.&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you fuckin'--"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lower back I think."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you ... where's the gun."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I threw it in the orchard."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You--"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I held up a hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to find it."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You--it's registered to me!"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to dump it."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sorry, Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely, man.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've made trouble for you here.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that."&nbsp;&nbsp;
I took a breath while he stayed quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I should be--I'm asking for your help.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I figure it might take both of us to remove the serial number tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The bench grinder can't keep a secret."&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw him picturing it:  fast, but really noisy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Somebody'd want to know why they had to crank the volume on the TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or want to kibbitz while watching sparks fly.&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I think we'll have to use hand tools."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He inventoried the workbench.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only battery-operated thing we had was a hobby Dremel and it
was broken.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah."&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his tin, took a dip and packed his lower lip.&nbsp;&nbsp;"When?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, two?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, scraping crumbs from his fingers back into the tin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, "Why didn't you use the Glock?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Couldn't find it."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank fuckin' God."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because, dumbass, the Glock ejects shells.&nbsp;&nbsp;With my fingerprints on 'em."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two on the dot.&nbsp;&nbsp;We grabbed a vice and every tool we could find that might successfully
attack stainless steel and put them in his truck.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the gun took a half hour with flashlights.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It helped that it was so shiny.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill extracted the shells and pocketed them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we drove to Alviso, 
a weird area at the southern tip of the San Francisco Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;To remove the number we ended up
using a hammer and punch set.&nbsp;&nbsp;After an early bad swing that nearly broke my finger and sent a
punch flying past his face and out into the weeds, we held the punch in place with locking pliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It took about two hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the number was gone Bill removed the spent shell from his pocket
and ceremoniously wiped it, flicked open the Colt, inserted it, and wiped again, rags in both hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I handed the big screwdriver to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your gun," I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be you."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plus my arms ain't puny."&nbsp;&nbsp;He rammed the screwdriver in and out of the barrel for a solid minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Either to defeat forensics or make it unusable if found.&nbsp;&nbsp;I figured the brackish water would
help too.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he gave it a good arc and we heard the splash.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nice one, Bill."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cowboy."&nbsp;&nbsp;That stuck for awhile.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first few times it seemed loaded with a 
mix of pride through conspiracy, envy born of naive fantasy, and a faint whiff of latent anger 
with the potential for idiotic double-edged blackmail.&nbsp;&nbsp;But then Beverly rebranded it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We waited a week before I bought him a new Colt.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that week I had butterflies and was mostly useless at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Things were okay with Bev, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday, we wheeled out the grill as usual and all the neighbors showed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevailing theories were
heart attack, stroke, and frying pan.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last from Elanor, a busybody from across the street
whose ancient hearing aids whistled the rockets'-red-glare part of the national anthem whenever she
turned her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that Tuesday she'd left a dish of stew covered in foil on Sal and Dee's porch
with a note to call her if they needed anything, only to find the foil shredded and the stew rat-eaten
the next morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly in her mind they deserved some shit for ignoring her kindness.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeks went by with no news.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last Friday of August I'm biting a dog when I see Dee pushing
Sal past the side of their house and then up the block.&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't look paralized in the chair,
but he didn't look good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone wanted to know.&nbsp;&nbsp;How was he?&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened?&nbsp;&nbsp;It was interesting
to see who asked what first.&nbsp;&nbsp;I interrupted.&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, we need to know:  Sal, can you drink beer?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and croaked, "No.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meds."&nbsp;&nbsp;Bev ran inside and pulled an old 
Perrier from some trench in the back of the fridge so he could hold a cold green bottle of fizz.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Dee did the talking.&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was a burglar.&nbsp;&nbsp;He came in with a ski mask on.&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Sal and shot
him from behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hid in the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;He stole a whole bunch of my jewelry.&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sal's going to be okay."&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualified.&nbsp;&nbsp;"He lost a kidney, some intestine.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The bullet missed his spine, but the shockwave did a bunch of nerve damage."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone asked if Sal would be going back to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desk jockey," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bev asked them if they wanted a burger or a dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal said, "Dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;With ev'thing you've got."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dee?" I said, risking eye contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Burger," she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric said, "Coming right up, if rare is okay."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grabbed a Rolling Rock from the cooler and opened it and handed it to Dee.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She took it over Sal's shoulder and said to me, "Thank you."&nbsp;&nbsp;Eye contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was that.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for thinking about what she must have done after I'd left.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burglar story was pretty iffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;But no recently fired weapon was found.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure the cops
checked she hadn't shot Sal with his own gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;She must have flushed her jewelry.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And put her clothes on before calling 9-1-1, because Sal wasn't in jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bandaids and gauze before clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And cleaned her blood off the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Slug in that wall?&nbsp;&nbsp;Two crimes, one scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Maybe put stuff in the washer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bleach.&nbsp;&nbsp;But why?&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortification?&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely.&nbsp;&nbsp;But.&nbsp;&nbsp;Love?&nbsp;&nbsp;Of?&nbsp;&nbsp;
And or, simply the simplest story she could think of?&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep me out of it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverly never mentioned not hearing the woman anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;She liked things simple, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some days I can rationalize it, but I don't really know if I saved a life by almost taking one,
or countered sickness with a dose of ruin.&nbsp;&nbsp;
