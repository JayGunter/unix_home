Sometime, 1986?&ensp;
<p/>
<i> Petit Mal </i>
<p/>
When the situation on Knights Bridge Road fell apart, with two of my friends and housemates deciding
they wanted to move back to Minnesota, Bill and I decided to rent a house in Boulder Creek, a tiny town
in the Santa Cruz mountains.&ensp;We knew Boulder Creek because it was near the end of the most enjoyable
part of Hwy 9, a beautiful winding road through the redwood forests, our favorite for motorcycling.&ensp;
The house had been built for someone in a wheelchair, with a mostly open floorplan and a wide hallway
that lead to small bedrooms, hardwood floors everywhere for easy rolling.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Riding Hwy 9 to work and back every day was fun, at first.&ensp;We mastered every curve, memorized every
bump and all the spots where vehicles could pop out of hidden sideroads.&ensp;
We became holy terrors.&ensp;Suzuki had just released the GSX-R 750, a race bike with turn signals.&ensp;
They were air-cooled, lightweight, and ungodly strong.&ensp;We'd get to one end of 9 or the other, pull in for
gas and say to each other, "Seriously, we need to fucking slow down."&ensp;But, nuh-uh.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The glitter was wearing off for Bill, though.&ensp;It took him an hour to get to work, drive a truck for 
8-10 hours, and then an hour home.&ensp;Even the best of fun can become a grind.&ensp;And it was right around
then that I drove my Firebird into the ditch in our little neighborhood.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;It was a fine morning, and I was headed to work.&ensp;Suddenly, I was standing next to the ditch, 
looking at a blue car, then slowly realizing the car probably shouldn't be tilted at that weird angle,
and realizing it was my car, and then noticing a few neighbors who'd already figured all that out.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Somebody may have asked what happened, and I may have tried to come up with a story.&ensp;But I had
no idea.&ensp;I must have walked back to my house and called for a tow truck, but I have no memory of
doing that.&ensp;I remember thinking I must have swerved to avoid something.&ensp;And that maybe I couldn't 
remember what because maybe I'd bounced my head against the steering wheel, although I didn't have a bump.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;That was the end of my beloved Firebird.&ensp;The frame was twisted.&ensp;I had a mechanic pull the motor
and other good stuff, thinking I'd transfer them, but never found a deserving host.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;With no car, I relied on riding a motorcycle to work.&ensp;But three weeks later, I was standing on
the side of the road.&ensp;<i> Huh, that's a motorcycle.&ensp;But it's on it's side.&ensp;It shouldn't be like that. </i>
<i> Hey, it's my motorcycle.&ensp;What happened? </i>  And having no idea.&ensp;I tried to tell myself a deer must
have jumped out in front of me.&ensp;What terrible luck I was having.&ensp;But I didn't remember a deer.&ensp;
Previous crashes (limit detection events, pavement quality assessments, technique refinement opportunities) 
had always had a clear instant-by-instant record to consult.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I do remember going in to town in my pickup to snag the weekly Auto Trader to look for a beater,
something disposable.&ensp;But reason kicked in.&ensp;The next crash might be into a tree or into a canyon
or an on-coming car or truck or a crosswalk full of school kids.&ensp;Maybe it wasn't reason, but just
the realization that there existed much more advanced levels of shame and consequences for truer idiots.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I'm sure I told Bill and I'm sure he concluded as I had that I needed to see a doctor.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;My memories in general around this time are so sketchy that I have to make a lot a guesses and assumptions.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The doctor told me I was likely having seizures.&ensp;I think he asked me how I got to the appointment,
and I'm sure I told him I drove.&ensp;Idiot.&ensp;I didn't need to admit that.&ensp;Or do it.&ensp;He told me that I 
should stop driving immeditately, that he would inform the DMV who would suspend my license,
and that he'd arrange an EEG test for the next morning.&ensp;
I had to stay awake for the 24 hours before the test.&ensp;
I wasn't fond of the guy.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Years later I would meet a couple, friends of a friend in San Francisco.&ensp;One was an aspiring doctor.&ensp;
Her untreated epileptic partner had just purchased a new car and would practically go <i> la-la-la </i> if
anyone, including poster-child me, tried to say driving was a bad idea for her.&ensp;
I told the smart one that this was a break-up scenerio.&ensp;Ratting out her girlfriend would end it.&ensp;
Staying would make her complicit in whatever horrible vehicular thing happened.&ensp;
I advised her to steal the other's keys and how to remove a distributor cap.&ensp;
It made me appreciate my doctor's position, but I wish he'd been nicer.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Out in the parking lot I looked at my little red pickup.&ensp;I thought about trying to sleep in it, but
since I was supposed to stay awake it was now utterly useless.&ensp;It had no radio.&ensp;
The hospital and doctors' offices were within walking distance of my job, but I couldn't imagine
faking my way through the day, so I walked the other way to the nearest motel and rented a room and
watched non-stop TV, breaking only to go out for food I could barely eat.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;For the EEG test, I lay on a bed and probably fell asleep before they glued all the wires to my head.&ensp;
And of course I had a seizure.&ensp;It turned out not to be the grand mal variety, with all the thrashing
and biting one's tongue.&ensp;The doctor called it a petit mal, or "little absense".&ensp;He scheduled an MRI
to see what there was to see.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I went back to the motel and slept again, both to catch up and hide.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The MRI showed nothing obviously wrong.&ensp;Funnily enough, I must have had a seizure afterward, because
the next morning I woke up thinking I needed to get that MRI, went to the hospital again and,
despite not being on the schedule, was given a second scan which my insurance refused to pay for.&ensp;
When the bill came I was too depressed to argue.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I was prescribed Dilantin.&ensp;Too strong a dose would give me a day of double vision.&ensp;I'd sit at
my desk trying to read my screen with one eye closed.&ensp;Too low a dose and it didn't do it's job.&ensp;
To determine that case, I bought a cheap sports watch that had a timer feature where, after 
counting down from 5 minutes to zero, it would beep and continue to count into negative seconds and minutes.&ensp;
I'd check it constantly.&ensp;If it hadn't counted down to zero, all was good.&ensp;When it beeped I'd 
restart the timer.&ensp;But if I'd missed the beep, I could assume I'd had a seizure.&ensp;I quickly learned 
how long 5 minutes was to minimize the number of times I checked each day.&ensp;Life in 5 minute chunks 
wasn't fun but it gave me a sense of control and confidence in the meds.&ensp;
That was about the best I could do to alleviate the ever-nagging worry.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Bill and I had to find an apartment near my work.&ensp;
I appreciated Bill sticking with me, but it was partially a financial decision for him.&ensp;
He needed a housemaate.&ensp;What we found wasn't anything special.&ensp;
It was a decent two bedroom in a little complex.&ensp;Our unit was directly across an open air walkway from the super's.&ensp;
He was an old guy named Chuck.&ensp;His entire ambition in life was to sneak beers from his 
disapproving wife.&ensp;He'd drink in the covered parking area, the laundry room, out front sitting 
on a curb hidden by a shrub.&ensp;Early on, as he was hustling away from his unit with a fresh can,
he gave me a look and I replied with a nod.&ensp;His wife came out seconds later.&ensp;"Chuuuuuck?"&ensp;
Always exactly the same way and so often it had long ago lost the distinction of cause and effect.&ensp;
She looked at me, and I shrugged.&ensp;I'm sure she knew I knew and had decided to side with him.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I bought a bicycle in a nice shade of blue.&ensp;I learned not to buy too much at the grocery store.&ensp;
Hanging bags from the handle bars was a demonstration of bad ideas in physics.&ensp;Get them swinging
even a little and I was swerving into traffic.&ensp;It never occurred to me to call a cab.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;There were trails that lead along some man-made ponds to my office.&ensp;In the evenings swallows 
would be swooping for bugs and I'd often stop and watch.&ensp;It was better than returning to the apartment.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;One afternoon, I was riding back from a dentist appointment, slowly and swerving a little.&ensp;
Half my face was numb with novocaine and I was slack-jawed and drooling as I pedaled along the trail.&ensp;
And that was the afternoon I encountered one of the most beautiful young women I had ever seen.&ensp;
She was riding a pink bike and wearing a skin-tight fuzzy pink bodysuit.&ensp;Flowing golden hair.&ensp;
Incredible.&ensp;For so many reasons there was no question of saying anything.&ensp;
Not that I'd've known what to say at my best, but she was a shining example of chances for happiness lost.&ensp;
Luckily, my sour-grapes circuit kicked on, and I remembered that a couple years before I'd taken up with
a different woman dressed daringly in public.&ensp;
I had a long conversation with myself about lust versus love
and admitted I'd many times, almost every time, ignored huge red flags in my satyric pursuits.&ensp;
That there were many reasons to love something or someone, and the trick was to know how long you
could ignore each hue of red, which were non-starters.&ensp;All that glitters is not gold, sure, but the 
wisdom of adages is lost without examples.&ensp;There should be mandatory classes, with essay assignments.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;During those months in that apartment, Bill picked up a stray.&ensp;
A wisp, both physically and in personality.&ensp;Rene had nothing but her clothes and I guessed
she was happy to be sleeping inside.&ensp;She disappeared after a week or two and I didn't ask.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Also during those months I became something of a stray myself at work.&ensp;I'd been in a 
group of four who went to lunch together nearly every day.&ensp;Because I'd been riding the bicycle
to work for a while, someone eventually asked about it and I explained my situation.&ensp;The next thing
I knew, I was out of the lunch club.&ensp;They started leaving early, without swinging by my office.&ensp;
As if epilepsy were contagious.&ensp;Fair-weather friends.&ensp;
I figured I simply no longer fit in.&ensp;The lunch conversation was strictly lightweight and
my deal would be the elephant at the table.&ensp;But I wasn't reinstated even after I started driving again.&ensp;
They knew they'd been shits and pretending otherwise wouldn't have worked.&ensp;
And there may have been other reasons.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;There was a shadowy guy at work, a fellow engineer who approached me obliquely, asking
questions about stuff I happened to know.&ensp;He timed his visits so he could ask if I wanted to 
have lunch.&ensp;Well-spoken, smart, quiet.&ensp;There was something wrong with the fingers on his right hand.&ensp;
One Friday he invited me to go with
him to a park to fly his radio-controlled toy plane.&ensp;We met there, he started its little motor,
and flew it around a bit.&ensp;Then he handed me the controller.&ensp;This was completely new for me, and
I didn't know what the joysticks did.&ensp;After a few seconds watching me steer it off course he said,
"Maybe I should take that back."&ensp;A few seconds later it smacked into a tree.&ensp;The damage was pretty bad,
but he said he could fix it.&ensp;I thought briefly about offering to help pay, but didn't.&ensp;
We drove back to his apartment which looked possibly pre-furnished, a hotel room feel.&ensp;
Except for the bong on his coffee table.&ensp;He got it going and told me the story of his fingers.&ensp;
He'd been in the navy, and one day tasked with cleaning a steam-driven screw-type pump mechanism.&ensp;
It involved removing an access panel on the side of a pipe and sticking his hand inside.&ensp;
Somebody in some other part of the ship turned the steam on and it had loped off his fingers.&ensp;
They had helicopered him, and his fingers in a paper cup clutched in his other hand, 
to a navy hospital where they had reattached them.&ensp;
They had him on morphine while he healed and he'd become addicted.&ensp;
"My hand felt better but my head sure didn't."&ensp;
He said he especially liked a particular feeling a hit of morphine gave, a relaxation in his face.&ensp;
The implication was that he wasn't an addict anymore.&ensp;
And I didn't buy it.&ensp;And I immediately saw a very dangerous parallel: another friend had introduced me
to marijuana and that had turned out okay.&ensp;However, this was a man on a much slipperier slope
and I wanted no part of it.&ensp;Unlike epilepsy, addiction was, at least potentially, a socially communicable disease.&ensp;
I made an excuse to leave, and thereafter cordial to him at work.&ensp;
It wasn't his fault, the scary fingers were an unfortunate cause, not an effect, but I didn't want 
to associate with him.&ensp;I've wondered how many people at work knew.&ensp;
Perhaps NA required him to be open, but I imagined a happier life keeping the former addiction a secret.&ensp;
It made me think that maybe I shouldn't feel obligated or even free to share my new problem.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The DMV wouldn't reverse my driver's license suspension until I was siezure-free for six months.&ensp;
When I thought about this, I realized that a lot of people in my position probably lied to get
their license back ASAP.&ensp;For me, it was maybe 8 or 9 months.&ensp;The interview with the DMV official
was weird.&ensp;He pretty much had to take my doctor's word, even though my doctor couldn't be sure.&ensp;
During the interview, I was checking my watch and explained my stopwatch system to him.&ensp;I think that 
only made him more reluctant.&ensp;But rules are rules and my driving privilege was restored.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I immediately bought a car.&ensp;It was ancient Corolla that once might have been a silvery blue.&ensp;
It had 4 doors, just to drive home it's absolute lack of sportiness.&ensp;It's interior was coming unglued 
from the metal.&ensp;The seats had an almost unbearable amount of personality.&ensp;But it ran like a magical top.&ensp;
One evening a guy from a neighboring apartment knocked on our door needing to 
jump start his car.&ensp;A tall black guy, friendly, we'd seen him around.&ensp;
(My roommate was generally racist, but often relented on an individual basis,
making me wonder how long it would take before he called bull on that part of his upbringing.)&ensp;
I maneuvered my Toyota near his space and we hooked up the cables.&ensp;Even with 
the boost he had trouble getting his engine to start.&ensp;In between attempts, as it was getting dark,
he leaned against his fender in exasperation and closed his eyes for a moment.&ensp;When he opened them,
he looked at my decrepit ride and said:  "That's runnin' <i>real</i> smooth."&ensp;
I told him it was the first lucky thing that had come my way in quite a while, 
to which he nodded like a fellow connoisseur of life's corruptions and incongruous compensations.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I'd supressed it, successfully laid low, but now allowed myself to crave normality.&ensp;
That meant a house at the end of 9, a beast of a car, motorcycles in plural.&ensp;But in that order.&ensp;
My seizure-caused crashes had all happened amongst those tall redwood trees and I was almost
superstitious about returning there.&ensp;So my approach was both gung-ho and paranoid.&ensp;
I called a realtor, scheduled a Saturday, saw three houses in the rain, chose the last one and
wrote a check for a downpayment.&ensp;With Bill renting a room, it wasn't even that much more than
splitting rent on a house.&ensp;But I drove the Corolla through the winter, 
like I was keeping my karmic head down, a non-believer's sacrifice to whatever god had it in for me.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;For that year, and years afterward, I'd worry about having a seizure in front of my coworkers,
fearing fake knee-jerk sympathy that would slowly reveal an instinctive rejection.&ensp;
That has never happened, to me.&ensp;But it happened to my officemate while working at Javasoft.&ensp;
It was one of the weirdest experiences I've had.&ensp;He and I were in a ridiculous "office" that
had previously been a large closet.&ensp;With normal offices all around us, our little work hovel
was windowless and so narrow our desks had to be shoved against the same wall and if the guy
deepest in needed to get out, the two other guys had to get up and push their chairs in to 
let it happen.&ensp;Dingy walls, buzzing lights, it had no ventilation.&ensp;In those days of CRT monitors,
that stupid room was 80 degrees every day.&ensp;We took lots of breaks.&ensp;The company gave away
bevs from the coolers in the cafeteria.&ensp;One day as one of my officemates and I were cruising 
the hallways with fresh drinks we came upon a little lounge with couches and a game console.&ensp;
No one was there and we sat down and fired up whatever game was in the machine.&ensp;
He lasted about ten seconds before telling me he was going to have a seizure and that
I needed to shove something into his mouth.&ensp;Then he went rigid, slid off the couch and 
started flopping around on the floor.&ensp;i tried forcing a pencil into his mouth like a horse bit
but his tongue kept pushing it out.&ensp;As I was looking around for another object, two engineers
came into the lounge and, completely ignoring what was happening on the floor between the
couch and the TV, sat and started playing the game.&ensp;Like we weren't there, at their feet.&ensp;
I wondered if they would have ignored a fire in the waste basket.&ensp;Or a punch on the nose.&ensp;
I pulled a cushion off a nearby chair and slid it under my officemate's head while trying to keep
him from banging against furniture.&ensp;His seizure lasted about five minutes.&ensp;When the thrashing
stopped, he was clearly exhausted.&ensp;As with me, it took a bit for him to reboot.&ensp;He seemed barely
aware of his surroundings, but seemed to recognize me.&ensp;He asked if I could lead him to a restroom.&ensp;
Which I tried to do, but it was an unfamiliar part of the building, and we wound up walking around
for a few minutes.&ensp;He seemed pretty out of things while we wandered.&ensp;I found one finally
and let him go in alone.&ensp;It's what I would have wanted.&ensp;It hadn't looked like he'd peed himself.&ensp;
When he came out about ten minutes later he looked better, but still dazed.&ensp;He wanted to 
go home.&ensp;We didn't stop by our office, but went straight out to the parking lot.&ensp;His car 
was a sparkly copper color.&ensp;I tried to gently ask if he felt okay enough to drive, but he didn't answer.&ensp;
He started the car and drove off and I never saw him again.&ensp;
Our manager was often not in the office.&ensp;I think she was on dialysis.&ensp;Even when she was in the office,
we often didn't interact.&ensp;I didn't hear anything about the guy and didn't try to look him up
in the phone book.&ensp;If he sought help from a neurologist, he likely wouldn't be driving for a while.&ensp;
If he didn't, he may have feared rejection.&ensp;I hadn't told him that I also had epilepsy,
but even if I had, that would not have necessarily made me look like an ally.&ensp;
There was a new contractor at his desk within a week.&ensp;
