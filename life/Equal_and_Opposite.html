<h3>Garage Stories, #1</h3>
<p/>
<i> Some evening in the early '80s </i> 
<p/>
<br/>&emsp;I exhaled a blue cloud, waited a sec to be sure I wasn't giong to launch into a bong water-spilling 
coughing fit, before passing the cheap plastic rig and lighter along.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"So," I said, taking my turn, "a couple days ago I'm on the RD at Stevens Creek and San Tomas
and this guy pulls up next to me in a primer gray Challenger with the rear end jacked way up and what 
looked like actual wrinkle-walls."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Whoa.&ensp;What'd he have on the fronts?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I nodded.&ensp;"Little skinny rims.&ensp;Not sure they were what you'd run at a drag strip, but not much good
for anything but going straight."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Big super-charger?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I nodded again.&ensp;"All chrome, sticking up through the hood."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"'Chutes on the back?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"No," I said.&ensp;"But he did have a NOS sticker on the front fender."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Cripes."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Right?&ensp;So I revved the little 400 at him and he revved back.&ensp;Made the super-charger, the whole car,
lean sideways a bit."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Okay, so?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"So, were're watching the cross traffic lights.&ensp;They go yellow.&ensp;I rev the RD to redline.&ensp;Our light 
turns green and the noise from his car practically made me shit my pants.&ensp;His rear bumper dropped,
like, at least twelve inches and he just jumped into the intersection.&ensp;Got about three-quarters across,
his bumper goes up and snaps back down, and he's halfway down the block.&ensp;And I'm still standing there
with the clutch in."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Think you could've taken him, though?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"No.&ensp;It was like, Newtonian."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Huh?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Equal and opposite.&ensp;Like, his moving forward pushed the rest of the world backward."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"I suppose that does actually happen.&ensp;A teensy little bit, anyway."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"That's was I was thinking.&ensp;Like all our footsteps, cars and trucks stopping and starting, cheetahs
taking off after zebras&mdash;"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Do they eat zebras?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"&mdash;must just all cancel out."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Or be too small to really change&mdash;what&mdash;like, the Earth's rotation?&ensp;The length of the day?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Or," I said, "in that guy's case, since we were pointed basically north, the tilt of Earth's axis."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Harsher winters."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Make it snow in San Jose."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Fucker.&ensp;I don't have tires for that."&ensp;
