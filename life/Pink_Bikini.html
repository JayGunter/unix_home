<h3>Hot Pink Bikini</h3>
<p/>
<i> Apr. 28, 1987 </i>
<p/>
I'd been living in Willow Glen for a couple years.&ensp;It was a reasonably nice part of San Jose.&ensp;
Older houses.&ensp;Ours was kind of strange.&ensp;It had a rather large kitchen with limited counter space,
as though the architect had imagined a dining table at the end, with a door leading to the back yard
and a bathroom near that door.&ensp;Everything in relentless yellow.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The driveway to the garage ran along that side of the house.&ensp;My Firebird was in the garage
keeping my housemate's pot plants company.&ensp;I was convinced they were cross-odorizing each other.&ensp;
The Bird smelled like indica and the bud tasted faintly of 10W-40 and tires.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The house next door was the mirror layout of ours, so the driveways ran adjacent.&ensp;That house had
been on the market and recently bought by a smarmy Armenian guy who promptly replaced the front lawn with 
concrete so customers of his insurance business had somewhere to park.&ensp;No street parking on Curtner Avenue.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;That day I pulled up on my motorcycle, clicked it into neutral and hit the kill switch, planning my
silent glide toward the back.&ensp;I had a dismount technique where, while gliding, I would stand on 
the left foot peg and swing my right leg over the seat so that when I feathered the brake to a stop
I'd be ready to flick the kickstand down, all in one fluid motion, much as I'd do on a bicyclc.&ensp;
But I stopped at the front because, dancing around in a little pink bikini, was an attractive woman
with a little watering can, sprinkling the new flowers edging the new concrete.&ensp;The flowers were pink too.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She gracefully stepped over the flowers and put the tip of her index finger on the top edge of my
bike's mirror and said:  "I like motorcycles."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Pulling off my helmet gave me a few seconds.&ensp;I said:  "It doesn't need watering."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"How 'bout you?"&ensp;She raised her can.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"I'm good for now."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Her smile sprouted horns.&ensp;"Will you give me a ride?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Motorcycles did draw women and this would momentarily baffle me because when a guy
gives another guy a ride there was usually an attempt to wheelie and dump your friend.&ensp;It's in the
Y chromosome rulebook somewhere.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Sure," I said.&ensp;Chivalry was also in the rulebook, at least towards women.&ensp;That meant that not
only didn't you try to dump them on the road or trail, you tried to protect them.&ensp;And that meant gear.&ensp;
I had a spare leather jacket and gloves.&ensp;I had a helmet that would fit her, well enough anyway.&ensp;
"Gotta wear jeans and shoes, though."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She gestured at the clothes she wasn't wearing.&ensp;"No?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Only in my dreams."&ensp;Of which.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Okay.&ensp;When?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Knock on the back door.&ensp;I've got to check my answering machine."&ensp;I did not.&ensp;But I needed to 
find a helmet that didn't smell like perfume.&ensp;My last pillion jockey was a real spritzer.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She leapt the flowers and loped down the Armenian's driveway in her flip flops.&ensp;I heard his back door 
open and close.&ensp;I pushed the bike to the front walk to make way in case either of my housemates came home.&ensp;
My helmet collection was in the garage.&ensp;I didn't want this woman to see the potted plants so I quickly 
hauled open the big door and pushed my Firebird out.&ensp;A lot of noise and wear and tear starting a cold motor,
and in those days I enjoyed pushing it, on flat ground anyway.&ensp;I had this idea that it somehow kept
me honest or appreciative or something.&ensp;Then I went into the garage and closed the big door behind me.&ensp;
From the grow lights I could see my small collection of brain buckets for smaller heads.&ensp;
I selected two and exitted via the side door.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;And there she was.&ensp;Jeans, tennies, tee, and a small duffel.&ensp;I closed the door against the wafting weediness,
thinking we really needed to put locks on the garage doors.&ensp;Less inconvenient than burglary or jail.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Can I drop this somewhere?"&ensp;She casually lifted the duffel.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Sure.&ensp;C'mon inside.&ensp;We'll get you a jacket."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"It's summer," she said.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Almost.&ensp;But I have a policy with motorcycles.&ensp;All the gear, every time."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Cautious," she said.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Gotta be.&ensp;Old cars drip oil at intersections, a braking hazard for sudden red lights."&ensp;
At the back door of the house now.&ensp;"Drivers turn left in front of bikes all the time, more panic braking."&ensp;
I checked the lower glass panes of the door before opening it.&ensp;My little black cat was eyeing the stranger.&ensp;
"Back up, Fred."&ensp;He did.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;My bedroom was immediately to the left with an identical door, odd for a bedroom.&ensp;I'd hung a random 
tablecloth on the inside.&ensp;Spartan.&ensp;A big bin of clean clothes, big bin for laundry, a pair of twin-sized
box springs and mattresses shoved together.&ensp;I slept diagonally to keep from pushing them apart.&ensp;
It's a habit I return to when circumstances allow, required or not.&ensp;I pulled one of my old jackets from 
the closet and turned to hand it to her.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;But she was looking down.&ensp;"Hi, Fred," she said.&ensp;I realized I liked her voice.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Fred," I said, "shoo."&ensp;He did a lithe feline uey.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I held out the jacket and she put it on.&ensp;The sleeves were long so I folded them back.&ensp;Then I handed
her a pair of gloves.&ensp;She pulled one on.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Uh," I said, "helmet first."&ensp;This was not a woman accustomed to the procedure.&ensp;Unless your gloves
fit perfectly it's impossible to do up a helmet strap.&ensp;It became obvious the strap buckle was a 
new thing too.&ensp;I'd given her the helmet that I guessed would fit best, and like many people, she had
that look of surprise at the novelty, the change in sounds.&ensp;Doing the strap brought us close.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Shake your head a bit."&ensp;Not too much slop.&ensp;"Good to go."&ensp;I lead us out.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Bye, Fred," she said.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;At the front of the house I walked the bike through a three-point turn so it was pointed at the Armenia's
little parking lot.&ensp;I folded down the passenger footpegs and she promptly went to sling a leg 
over the seat but I stopped her with a hand on her shoulder.&ensp;Another touch, procedural again, but still.&ensp;
"Driver first."&ensp;I got on, flicked the kickstand and said, "Okay."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She put her foot on the peg and her hands on my shoulders and swung herself aboard.&ensp;The rear suspension
sagged with the extra weight but only an inch.&ensp;I tended toward stiff settings.&ensp;I started the bike just
as my housemate pulled into the drive in his ancient VW Fastback.&ensp;He stopped.&ensp;I waved and she did too.&ensp;
Then I drove between a couple of bunches of the pink flowers, across the Armenian's new concrete, checked
over my shoulder, and eased the bike onto Curtner.&ensp;We were only three houses from the light and it was 
red.&ensp;"Lean into corners with me," I said over my shoulder.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Okay."&ensp;Her arms were already around my waist, hands clasped.&ensp;While waiting for green,
she unclasped them and put her palms on my thighs.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I saw the light for cross traffic go yellow and said, "Okay."&ensp;She clasped her hands again.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I drove through downtown Willow Glen thinking about a coffee shop but it was too close.&ensp;So I headed for
Los Gatos.&ensp;She was leaning correctly in turns.&ensp;Curving onto the highway ramp I said, "Hold on!"&ensp;
I felt her grip tighten.&ensp;I gave her what, in my experience, women seem to want from a motorcycle ride.&ensp;
We merged at ninety, a limit set by 
<i>thrill-me-but-don't-kill-me</i>, a syndrome originating in infants' memories of
being tossed in the air by their fathers, something I'd never seen a mother do, undoubtably due to 
greater investment.&ensp;
I checked mirror and over my shoulder, caught a glimpse of her smiling,
and shifted left to the fast lane.&ensp;I slowed a bit as I recalled having had to switch the
bike to its reserve tank on my way home which meant we'd left with a little over a half gallon of fuel.&ensp;
We were halfway through that, but Los Gatos wasn't far.&ensp;We'd make it, but would have to stop.&ensp;
So we did, at the Chevron, my preferred brand.&ensp;Expensive, but had tested best for burning cleanly.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She seemed to intuit the dismount procedure, but when I felt her hands on my shoulders I said, "Hold on."&ensp;
I felt some squirrelliness under my right sole, grit and oil.&ensp;It wouldn't do to topple in front of 
the general public.&ensp;I eased the bike foward with my left foot and felt with my right again.&ensp;
Better.&ensp;"Okay."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She hopped off, as neatly as any.&ensp;I liked her.&ensp;I wondered if she was still wearing the bikini
under her clothes.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I pulled off one glove to facilitate popping the gas cap.&ensp;She started to emulate but I said,
"Don't bother, this won't take long."&ensp;I was a familiar customer to the guy inside, so I waved and 
he enabled the pump.&ensp;I filled the tank, and closed the cap.&ensp;"Be one sec," I said and went inside to pay.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Running her up 9?" the guy inside asked, referring to the nearby windy road popular with bikers.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I paused while fishing an appropriate bill from my wallet.&ensp;"Dunno."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;He said, "Heard there was a wreck up there earlier."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"While ago?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Not long."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Good to know.&ensp;Thanks much."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;He saluted and handed me my change.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;At the bike I told her:  "There's a problem on Highway 9.&ensp;I'm thinking we should change plans."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"There were plans?" she said.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Maybe it was because her helmet was Yamaha yellow, but her eyes were very blue.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I thought of three different things to say and felt mature for rejecting them.&ensp;"Do you like seafood?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Horns.&ensp;"Like what?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I pointed to a place down the street.&ensp;"Oysters Rockefeller."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I spun us over there, parked and we got seats at the bar.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Their arrival raised an eyebrow, but they were very pretty, lovely shells on a bed or rock salt,
and when she saw me eat one she quickly followed suit.&ensp;Her expression was like watching a kaleidoscope
that settled on fascination with what had happened in her mouth.&ensp;I ordered a glass of dry riesling
for her.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Can I have one of these?"&ensp;She was holding her last oyster shell.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"That's how they come.&ensp;They don't reuse them.&ensp;Wipe it clean, though, before you put it in your pocket."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I watched her pick her favorite and lick a smidge of cheese from its edge.&ensp;Nice hands, no polish.&ensp;
Nice lips, also bare.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I ran us back to Willow Glen.&ensp;It was dark now.&ensp;Our driveway was passable, but the area in front of the 
garage was a bit crowded with my Firebird, the Fastback, and my other housemate's Honda Civic.&ensp;
But there's always room to park a bike.&ensp;We went inside where housemates and cats were watching TV in a room
maybe intended for a dining room table.&ensp;Four heads turned when we came in.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Hey," I said to them, and opened my bedroom door.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She waved.&ensp;Fred gave her the slow blink.&ensp;She hadn't even fed him anything.&ensp;Mr. Fastback was the pot
grower and he just looked.&ensp;Mr. Civic, a water polo coach who had California written all over him,
gave us a shaka sign.&ensp;He seemed to share Fred's opinion.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;In my bedroom I tossed my helmet and jacket and gloves on the mattresses, noting her duffel there.&ensp;
I helped her again undo the D-ring strap closure on the helmet.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Need a bathroom break?"&ensp;It had been a few hours.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Um--okay."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I opened the other door in my odd study/bedroom.&ensp;The bathroom door was a few feet down the hall.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Alone now, I started trying to assemble options, but very soon heard the toilet flush and she was back.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Quick," I said.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Right down to business," she answered.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I closed the hall door, and opened the glass-paned door and we were again the subject of attention.&ensp;
I said, "We're--"&ensp;I looked at her.&ensp;She'd been looking at the spectators, but with my pause she faced me.&ensp;
I continued, "--going to the movies?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Sure," she said.&ensp;Her eyes were blue anywhere.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Nice," said the coach.&ensp;"Have fun, guys."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Out the back door, I walked around and opened the passenger door of the Firebird.&ensp;
She assessed what the dome light revealed and got in.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I came around and hopped in and started the car.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Ooh."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"I'll let it warm up a bit," I said.&ensp;The dome was off but I turned it back on.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She was casually reclined and looking at me.&ensp;Between us was a prototype center console I had 
cobbled from a large piece of smooth-sided rather stiff foam I'd found glued to the inside of a 
large cardboard box that had contained a very heavy piece of equipment delivered to a company
sharing the parking lot where I worked.&ensp;It covered the transmission hump of the Firebird.&ensp;It was white,
not matching the car's blue interor, a long, obviously owner-fabricated, flat surface.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Okay if I rest my arm on this?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"That's what it's for."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Her hand immediately found the Bic in it's slot at the front of the foam block.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"You smoke?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Not cigarettes."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Me neither."&ensp;She manipulated the lighter with great familiarity.&ensp;"Well, not for a while now."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I reached across to the glove box and pulled out a plastic film canister given to me by someone
who owned a camera.&ensp;Inside was some desiccated bud and a half-finished joint.&ensp;I brushed the flakes from it
and handed it to her.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"You roll this?" she asked, sparking the lighter.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Yep," I answered, wondering.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She took a cautious hit, rolled down her window, and exhaled toward the Armenian's back yard.&ensp;
Then she eased back against the headrest, holding the joint my way.&ensp;"I like your style."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I took a hit and lowered the driver's side window.&ensp;"What?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"What?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"What do you mean?&ensp;Style."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Oh," she said.&ensp;"I don't like pinners."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Ah," I said.&ensp;"Me neither.&ensp;Taste like paper."&ensp;I snuffed and stowed the J and put the car in gear,
easing down the drive.&ensp;Through the kitchen window I saw the coach had just filled a glass with water.&ensp;
He raised it.&ensp;I flashed him a vee.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;To avoid scraping the nose of the Firebird on the street I'd learned the magic angle to ease out.&ensp;
The light was only a few houses down and I let the car ride its idle into the left turn lane.&ensp;
While waiting for the green, I said:  "The seat belt is old school."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;While she figured out it was a non-retracting affair that needed some fiddling to get straight she said:
"All the gear . . ."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I confirmed:  "Every time.&ensp;Oh, and roll up your window."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I heard the buckle click.&ensp;Her window went up.&ensp;The light changed.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;It had taken me a while to figure out that I'm really more interested in cornering than straight line speed.&ensp;
It had then taken some experimenting, wider wheels, various tires, sway bars, adjustable shocks, to get
the big car to do what I wanted.&ensp;Labors of love are forever works in progress.&ensp;
Passions are a kind of trap we pay to get into, stay in.&ensp;Or some crap.&ensp;Drop the clutch.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Unhhhh!"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;It was impressive, especially in first gear, the sudden snarl, the car leaping both forward and sideways.&ensp;
I preferred to initiate first-time passengers with a left-hand turn to push them against their door 
instead of toward me.&ensp;Though one, fearing defenestration, had tried to grab my arm.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I powered on the stereo.&ensp;Boston, "More Than A Feeling."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Jesus," she said.&ensp;"Do that again."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I took a detour to let her experience the only twisty spot in the neighborhood, Dry Creek Road.&ensp;
I considered it my testing area.&ensp;
Later the city installed traffic lights along there.&ensp;Closest I'd get to a statue.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The route to the theater had us on El Camino Real.&ensp;Three lanes wide each way, center turn lane,
and breakout right-turn lanes at each intersection.&ensp;It wasn't a Friday or Saturday night but the Firebird still 
attracted a friendly challenger at the first red light.&ensp;Vroom, vroom.&ensp;But here she surprised me.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Don't, okay?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I looked at her.&ensp;"You see a cop?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"No, and I really don't want to."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I turned to the guy on my left.&ensp;"Not tonight, man.&ensp;The lady isn't into it."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;He leaned over his wheel of his GTO to have a look, then laughed the laugh of the unemcumbered.&ensp;
We waited through the long cycle, admiring each others' noises.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She was watching the cross traffic and when it slowed she put her hand over mine as if to 
help or prevent me shifting.&ensp;A picture is worth a thousand words, but a first direct touch 
holds only a handful of possibilities.&ensp;Sort them any way you like.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;On green the guy next to us tore off.&ensp;It's hard to judge from a docile perspective, 
couldn't say if I'd've bested him.&ensp;But maybe I already had.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;At the cineplex she was definitely my friend now.&ensp;Holding my hand in the ticket line and the popcorn line.&ensp;
We watched something while a different movie played in my head.&ensp;Our hands kept meeting in the paper bucket
like friendly dogs at a park.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;After the show she hit the ladies' and like before was out in record time.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"So," I said.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"So."&ensp;She took my hand and we walked out to my car.&ensp;My inner movie had come up with too many
dialog options for me to choose from.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"I left my bag at your place."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Right."&ensp;I drove us back to Willow Glen.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;No one was staying up for us except the cats who were doing their usual after-dark hardwood floors 
chase-and-skid games.&ensp;She giggled as they slid past us, bounced off the door and peeled out again.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;In my bedroom, I turned on my closet light and cleared the motorcycle jackets,
helmets and gloves from the mattresses.&ensp;There was her duffel.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I looked at her.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"It could stay there," she said, very softly but not whispering.&ensp;Her eyes were blue in near darkness.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"It can."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The cats thundered past.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"What's the big orange one called?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Leon."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Right."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"What are you called?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The horns curled tight and eased.&ensp;"Beverly."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"That's a nice name."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"It means, home of the beaver."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;My movie script hadn't had that line.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Like," she said, "beaver and then lee, L-E-E."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Huh."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Can I take off my shoes?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Sure."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She sat on the mattress, undid her laces, removed her shoes, stood, and slid out of her shirt and pants,
and then the bikini.&ensp;Things went everywhere, snowing girl stuff.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Want to take yours off?" she asked.&ensp;This woman had octaves.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Sure."&ensp;I wasn't as graceful, but tried to be.&ensp;Standing.&ensp;Socks are spoilers.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She crossed her ankles and turned in front of me like a ballerina on a music box.&ensp;
No butt ink or body hair.&ensp;
Preference versus causation.&ensp;
The twirl likely just vroom.&ensp;
That smile now assymetrical.&ensp;
It stayed on.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Morning came with the scrape and soft slam of the back door opening and closing.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Out my window I saw the coach get into his Civic.&ensp;The Fastback was already gone.&ensp;I'd slept well.&ensp;I usually do.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Beverly was sitting on the edge of the mattress reading my journal.&ensp;It was a large sketch pad 
because I didn't like my private thoughts to be ruled.&ensp;I used a Fountain Pentel for it's 
flexible tip.&ensp;Occasionally, a letter stroke would release tension and with it a delicate spray of blue.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"You have nice penmanship."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"So do you."&ensp;Silly, but my intent came across.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She closed my journal.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;At a nearby breakfast joint, as our plates arrived, she asked:  "So you can take the day off?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I'd called my office from the place's payphone.&ensp;"Nothing's on fire."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"There, anyway."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Eggs Benedict was new for her.&ensp;First time for everything.&ensp;I realized I was in the midst of my
first time with something, and not just with her specifically.&ensp;I simply didn't know what it was yet.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I said:  "How about the beach?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;A mouthful of breakfast, hollandaise at the corner, her eyes sparkled like the bay.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;It wasn't until we were halfway to the coast, the Firebird purring its way up and over the Santa Cruz
mountains, that it occurred to me.&ensp;"I guess you can take a day off working for what's-his-name?"&ensp;
Dancing around in a bikini watering flowers.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She was relighting the joint.&ensp;Got it going and handed it to me.&ensp;"Done with that."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Ah.&ensp;That was it.&ensp;At least a glimpse of it.&ensp;This, maybe I, was a that.&ensp;Whatever that meant.&ensp;
I held the joint and thought about it, then took a fatalistic hit.&ensp;I'd find out.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Because it was a weekday the traffic into Santa Cruz was light.&ensp;I told her that I usually
skipped past Santa Cruz to head north to a couple of secluded beaches my housemates had shown me,
but today wanted to hit the wharf and buy some big towels.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She laughted.&ensp;"You don't have all the gear?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"I did."&ensp;I told her the story of my necklace, a silver rope holding a rough piece of abalone shell.&ensp;
I'd seen the bit of shell in the water the last time I'd been.&ensp;It was magically prismatic and tumbling
around my ankles in the surf.&ensp;It was so elusive I hadn't noticed the sneaker wave that hit me
waist-high, knocked me over, and stole my towel, a shoe and my sandwich.&ensp;But when I sat up, the
bit of shell had been in my hand.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Lunch on the wharf made shopping easy.&ensp;I bought her sunglasses and a big hat.&ensp;At the car, I put the
new towels in the salt-encrusted gym bag that the wave hadn't quite taken, likely because it had
been weighted down by a nearly new bottle of sunscreen.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I drove north along the coast, noting turnouts where the cliff had been cut nearly to the road by
hydrodynamics and time.&ensp;At one with no cars I pulled across the southbound lane and parked.&ensp;
The wind was blowing, as always.&ensp;Trains of brown pelicans were cruising south just offshore.&ensp;
We picked our way down the cliff to the tiny beach.&ensp;I spread the new towels, flopped down and said:
"Oh, shoot."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Beverly smiled and pulled the joint and lighter from her bikini top.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;We had to get back into the chilly shade of the cliff to get enough out of the wind.&ensp;
Two hits apiece and it was getting short.&ensp;I snuffed it against the ragged rock wall.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Sitting on her towel under her big hat she remarked:  "White caps."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Yeah, I was hoping it'd be a bit warmer.&ensp;Would be with less wind."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She turned.&ensp;"Here."&ensp;She rolled onto her knees while pulling one leg from her panties and putting it
across me.&ensp;Then she arched her back to unclip her top and let it slide down her arms.&ensp;
I was warmer.&ensp;It felt like a fashion shoot.&ensp;She kept the hat and shades,
<br/>&emsp;We climbed the cliff and reached the top right as another car parked behind mine.&ensp;We said hi as 
they got out and we got in.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Ooh," she said, "ahh," squirming on the passenger seat.&ensp;I was glad I'd put sheepskin covers over the vinyl.&ensp;
Completely changes the sun-baked car experience.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I stopped at the taqueria on the edge of town.&ensp;I broke my policy and got a Corona with my carne asada plate,
but only drank half.&ensp;She finished hers and fell asleep on the drive home.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;And home it apparently was now.&ensp;And I didn't know what to do about that.&ensp;It had never happened
with me and my housemates before.&ensp;Dating, sleepovers, sure, but it was plain that Beverly had no where
else to be, or perhaps go.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Do we need to pick up any stuff from anywhere?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She looked at me as if she'd known this polite question had to have been a red flag on my horizon.&ensp;
If I'd been hearing any lines til now, this one sounded the most over-thought:  "Nah.&ensp;I travel light."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;It begged other questions while implying they'd be best unasked.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;That was part of this.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Another part presented itself almost immediately.&ensp;
I was grabbing a couple of Cokes from the fridge and saw the Civic and the Fastback go past the window
toward the back.&ensp;Coincidence.&ensp;Or maybe they'd met after work somewhere.&ensp;I wondered what for.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The back door opened as I handed Beverly a can.&ensp;We'd been watching MTV with the cats.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Hey," the coach said, to me, "can you take a look at this car thing?"&ensp;To her he said,
"Shouldn't take long."&ensp;No tone, the dude was cool.&ensp;But.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Outside, it was clear there was no car thing.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The coach said to me:  "So.&ensp;Things going well?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Yeah."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Thing is," said my other housemate, Leon's owner, Mr. Fastback, "like, who <i>is</i> she?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Beverly," I said.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;There was a pause.&ensp;I said, "We need some locks on the garage.&ensp;I'll do that."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"When?" he asked.&ensp;"She seems to just <i>be</i> here."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;A day.&ensp;I said:  "I know."&ensp;And I did.&ensp;"But I think she understands the situation."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Do <i>you</i>?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I paused again.&ensp;I checked my voice.&ensp;"Well, if we need to establish some rules, we can.&ensp;
I understand if a fourth person starts staying here, that's a thing."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Yeah," he snorted.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"So," I said, "I'm prepared to pay a larger perentage of rent, if--"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"It's not that," he said.&ensp;"I've got--" and he thumbed toward the garage.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Well," I said, "she smokes weed like us.&ensp;I don't see her calling the cops."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"But what about friends?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Like, thieves?&ensp;I'll admit I don't know her that well.&ensp;But if she starts to act fishy--"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"It'd happen fast," he interrupted.&ensp;"She'll call someone while we're all out, and--"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Right, so I'll put locks on the doors.&ensp;Today."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The coach had been standing by, all Californian.&ensp;"So," he asked Mr. Fastback, "will that do it?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"What about my stereo?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Look," I said, "I'll replace anything that goes missing.&ensp;Gosh, these concerns seem to have 
come up pretty quick.&ensp;I mean, she's only been here one night--"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Is she staying tonight?" Fastback pressed.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Unless I'm going to take her to a hotel," I answered.&ensp;I checked myself again.&ensp;
"Tell you what, guys.&ensp;Let's all go to dinner."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The coach started nodding.&ensp;Dude burned a million calories in the pool every day.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I went on:  "She'll be less of an unknown.&ensp;You'll have a better read on her.&ensp;Or did she already
give a bad vibe or . . ."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Not for me," said the coach.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"She's friends with the cats," I said.&ensp;Breathe, be cool.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Let's go to the burger place," said the coach.&ensp;"I could go for their Chili Size."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Mr. Fastback was parked best.&ensp;"You driving?" I asked him.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;He nodded, seeming disappointed his freak-out was being short-circuited so soon.&ensp;As for the coach,
I don't think he had any real worries.&ensp;He didn't really own anything worth stealing.&ensp;How much can you 
get for a second-hand Speedo?&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;As I turned back toward the house I found myself wondering how they even knew she'd spent the night.&ensp;
Then I remembered her giggling at the cats.&ensp;And some other noises.&ensp;Jealous, Mr. Fastback.&ensp;
If you aren't having fun, no one can,  But as I turned the knob, on another level, yep, driving into fog.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Hey," I said to Beverly, "we're heading out for burgers."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She powered off the TV and moved the cats.&ensp;They were sharing her lap.&ensp;Wise guys.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She and I climbed into the back of the Fastback.&ensp;There was a hole in the vinyl seat about the size of a
dollar bill revealing the horizontal wavy seat springs, one of which had a missing section.&ensp;
Beneath the springs was a piece of plywood.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I told her:  "Ask our driver how that hole came to be."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;She peered at him in the mirror as he backed down the driveway.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Ah," he said.&ensp;"Yeah.&ensp;Well.&ensp;Me and my ex were, uh--"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"Getting heavy," the coach said.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;"--yeah.&ensp;And it turns out that the battery is right underneath the seat.&ensp;So when two people . . .&ensp;
with two people's weight, it was enough to . . ."&ensp;He was smirking and snorking by now.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;The coach finished:  "To make the seat springs make contact with the battery terminals."&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Beverly started laughing.&ensp;A rich contralto, very infectious.&ensp;It went on for at least two blocks.&ensp;
We were wiping our eyes when we got to the place.&ensp;As she was getting out she gave the hole and 
springs a quick look and asked:  "Anybody get branded?"&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;I'd never thought to ask.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;Mr. Fastback turned pink as Bev's bikini.&ensp;
<br/>&emsp;We were seated in a booth, were holding menus, and crying so hard we could hardly order.&ensp;
