### Garage Stories, #1

* Some evening in the early '80s * 

  I exhaled a blue cloud, waited a sec to be sure I wasn't giong to launch into a bong water-spilling 
coughing fit, before passing the cheap plastic rig and lighter along.
  "So," I said, taking my turn, "a couple days ago I'm on the RD at Stevens Creek and San Tomas
and this guy pulls up next to me in a primer gray Challenger with the rear end jacked way up and what 
looked like actual wrinkle-walls."
  "Whoa.  What'd he have on the fronts?"
  I nodded.  "Little skinny rims.  Not sure they were what you'd run at a drag strip, but not much good
for anything but going straight."
  "Big super-charger?"
  I nodded again.  "All chrome, sticking up through the hood."
  "'Chutes on the back?"
  "No," I said.  "But he did have a NOS sticker on the front fender."
  "Cripes."
  "Right?  So I revved the little 400 at him and he revved back.  Made the super-charger, the whole car,
lean sideways a bit."
  "Okay, so?"
  "So, were're watching the cross traffic lights.  They go yellow.  I rev the RD to redline.  Our light 
turns green and the noise from his car practically made me shit my pants.  His rear bumper dropped,
like, at least twelve inches and he just jumped into the intersection.  Got about three-quarters across,
his bumper goes up and snaps back down, and he's halfway down the block.  And I'm still standing there
with the clutch in."
  "Think you could've taken him, though?"
  "No.  It was like, Newtonian."
  "Huh?"
  "Equal and opposite.  Like, his moving forward shoved the rest of the world backward."
  "I suppose that does actually happen.  A teensy little bit, anyway."
  "That's was I was thinking.  Like all our footsteps, cars and trucks stopping and starting, cheetahs
taking off after zebras--"
  "Do they eat zebras?"
  "--must just all cancel out."
  "Or be too small to really change--what--like, the Earth's rotation?  The length of the day?"
  "Or," I said, "in that guy's case, since we were pointed basically north, the tilt of Earth's axis."
  "Harsher winters."
  "Make it snow in San Jose."
  "Fucker.  I don't have tires for that."
