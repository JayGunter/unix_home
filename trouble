Sometime around 2017, I was at Rand's place in Pine Mountain Lake for a "Dude's Weekend".
While out for a walk, the group stopped on a hillside with a dry creek at the bottom.
Rand was sitting higher up the slope from everyone else, and out-of-the-blue said,
  "Jay's the guy who'll always be in trouble."
The other Jay, Nitikman, looked at me as if to say, "He's talking about you," or
"You've just been dissed," or "I think he's right."  I looked away, toward the creek, 
and wished I had a quick witty comeback, one that wouldn't make me sound like an angry loser.
  It was probably meant as a "bro" joke, but it seemed too pointed.  Maybe because 
it was pointed at me.  So one takeaway was to avoid making such jokes myself in the future.
  But it's kept coming back to me, until now it seems likely that Rand really 
doesn't think much of me.  And perhaps by telling some of my stories of coolness or bravado
have left an unintended and lasting impression.  Maybe time to can those stories.
While they may have won favor with younger audiences, they probably just seem like I'm
trying too hard now.

But in the grand Bill Beck tradition of thinking up clever retorts hours-days-weeks too late,
Here are a few:

  "Your Shadenfreud is showing."

  "Yeah, my road hasn't always been easy, but that look of smug superiority 
makes it all worthwhile."

  "And it seems Rand will always have that unfortunate cocaine problem."

  "Trouble is just Fun's slutty sister.  Put Fun in a short skirt and high heels
and by midnight I'll as likely be in Fun as in Trouble."


Might Clio have a haiku for Trouble = Fun ?

  Trouble:  Fun's sister

  Trouble is Fun's slutty sister

  Trouble, slut sister of Fun,
  

Trouble's Fun's slutty sister
Can't tall which til I've kissed her

I can, to both, administer

  "Our host has painted himself into a corner.  He can proudly explain what he meant by that remark,
or refuse from lack of self-respect."

  "Explain that, please."

---

  "Oof, insulting the guests at your own party, McKinney?  
And you think you're looking good right about now?"

---

  "Yeah, when you're really good in bed, trouble just follows you around."

---

  "Slander.  No man is perfect, and I can pass judgement on you, too.  But I don't want to go there.
Let's think of something else to do."

---

Maybe he was thinking of having a daughter, speaking from his own experience.
Might've been a sharing moment.
So, neutral is best (make no assumptions):

"What do you mean?"

---

"Supercilious and sladerous, and in that order."

---

You're rather full of yourself and also full of shit.  
Be more careful with your words.

---

That's a pretty broad condemnation, verging on character assasination.
I can take a joke, but I don't like being judged, especially in front of friends.
But if you have constructive criticism, by all means pull me aside.

---

Hey, you can't make a terrible sweeping judgement like that
without following up with some amusing anecdotes.
Otherwise, you just look mean spirited.

---

What to do when the host take a big supercilious shit in the punch bowl?  Don't drink the punch.

---

Sorry, I'm not going to bite that hook.

---

Hey, now, Rand.  I can take a joke, and I encourage constructive criticism.  
But I won't have my character assassinated.
And I'd rather the host of the party not take a shit in the punch bowl.

---

Hmmm.   What can one do but try to be a better man each day.  Improve the important things.
Don't get down on yourself.  Don't belittle others.

---

I have no idea what you meant by that, and I strongly suspect you can't defend it.
But, let's have it:  What did you mean by that?

---

"Tell us what you mean by that, Rand."

A command (stronger than a question or remark) that 
- "tell us" puts me in the group and him (emphasized by naming him) outside it,
  reversing the "Jay's the guy" ostracism.
- implies disapproval 
- threatens public embarassment

"Tell me" in a 1-1 situation.

---

I thought we were all above making mean-spirited and slanderous remarks.
But apparently, Rand's the guy who isn't.


---

Hm.  This isn't your finest hour.

---

Hey, now.  Don't slander people.  It's potentially damaging, and it's beneath you.

---

Hm, I don't actually have any trouble.  So I guess that was meant as a joke.
Perhaps a back-handed compliment on--guessing here--having an adventurous nature.

---

Oh?  What trouble am I in now, according to you?

---

I can see you'd enjoy that, if it were true.  
And now we know you're the guy who wishes ill upon his friends.
Anything else you want to say?
No?
See.  Apology doesn't even come to mind.  Q.E.D.

---

That's a pretty lame attempt at gaslighting.
Telling a nasty lie to undermine someone's reputation and self-confidence.
It's a game where you abuse trust, usually with friends or family.
Probably play that shit on your wife too.

---

Whatever you got in mind ain't as much as you think.

---

Hey, you know--pointy remarks--take the day off.

---

I frown.  "I'm sorry, what was that?"
He repeats it.
I smile.  "Hmm.  That's what I thought you said."
(The phrase expresses distaste, but manner suggests dismissal.)
I say:  "What makes you say that?"
